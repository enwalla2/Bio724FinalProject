# Bio724FinalProject
This is the repo for my final project in Bio724 relating to population genetics in sea urchins. 

## Background
We work with two species of urchins that are closely related but about 5 myathere wasadivergence that led to one species being a planktotrophic urchin (small eggs, feeding larvae) and one species being a lecithotrophic urchin (large eggs, non-feeding larvae, accelerated development). Leveraging this system to study development, I want to look at population data to see if a lot of the differences we see between the species genetically are different in the regions where both species overlap (allopatry) versus where only the lecithotrophic urchins exist (sympatry). Additionally, there are some sex ratio inconsistencies in the region of overlap versus no overlap that Iâ€™d like to explore. It is possible that some of this is do to a symbiotic bacteria that adds another layer to the analysis.

Heliocidaris tuberculata = planktotrophic, indirect developer, in Australia 
Heliocidaris erythrogramma = lecithotrophic, direct developer, in Australia
Lytechinus variegatus = planktotrophic, indirect developer, off the coast of NC (used for comparisons and because we can access it easily)

## Aims

### Aim 1: Explore the relationship between life history and population structure in the heliocidaris genus. 
The influence of population structure on life history or vice versa hasn't really been well characterized. 

### Aim 2: To characterize distribution and varied impact of known symbiont E. raffii bacteria between regions of sympatry and allopatry between H. erythrogramma and H. tuberculata. 



## Additional/Future Questions

Can we make hybrids with other erythrogramma populations easier???? (Pre-Zygotic barriers)
mtDNA sequencing???
