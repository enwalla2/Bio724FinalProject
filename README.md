# Bio724FinalProject
This is the repo for my final project in Bio724 relating to population genetics in sea urchins. 

## Background
We work with two species of urchins that are closely related but about 5 myathere wasadivergence that led to one species being a planktotrophic urchin (small eggs, feeding larvae) and one species being a lecithotrophic urchin (large eggs, non-feeding larvae, accelerated development). Leveraging this system to study development, I want to look at population data to see if a lot of the differences we see between the species genetically are different in the regions where both species overlap (allopatry) versus where only the lecithotrophic urchins exist (sympatry). Additionally, there are some sex ratio inconsistencies in the region of overlap versus no overlap that Iâ€™d like to explore. It is possible that some of this is do to a symbiotic bacteria that adds another layer to the analysis.
